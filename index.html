      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Misheal — a lifelong learner with a passion for helping others grow and succeed.
      </p>
      <p>I specialize in creating clarity where there’s complexity. Whether it’s onboarding new employees, writing user-friendly documentation, or supporting systems operations, my goal is to make information accessible and processes efficient.
      </p>
      <p>With a background in IT support, training, and content creation, I bring a unique blend of technical know-how, communication skill, and hands-on problem-solving. I’ve led onboarding programs, written instructional guides and training videos, and helped improve workflows in fast-paced environments.
      </p>
      <p>I’m energized by opportunities to equip others, streamline systems, and improve how teams share knowledge. Whether I’m documenting a process, training a team, or resolving a system issue, I strive to deliver work that empowers people and drives results.
