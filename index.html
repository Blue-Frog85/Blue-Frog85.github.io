            <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Presently I am working at Amazon as a Warehouse associate. I have a desire and passion to enter back into the IT field, after having to spend time away from it due to a prior lack of job security at my previous job. Overall, I have worked in IT for about 7 years. </p>
            
            <p>I am presently working on growing and devolping my skills with coding and programing.  I have a strong grasp of HTML5 and CSS. I have a familiarity with basic UI design and am in the progress of learning JavaScript. I have a long term goal to enter into web devolpment/software engineering. </p>
            
            <p>If you wish to contact me directly, you can navigate to the contact page.  The projects page will eventually feature some of the coding projects that I have worked on or am working on.  The 'For Fun' page is under construction and will be an area to hopefully feature something of interest to me to express who I am beyond my interestin in coding.</p>
