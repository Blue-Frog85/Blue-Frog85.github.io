            <h2>About</h2>
             <p>I have been involved with IT work for over five years. In my current position, I work as an IT service operations support specialist tier 2. 
                    My main focus in this position is working with mobility. I troubleshoot mobile phones - setup, application issues, and assist with MDM profiling. 
                    I also have skills working with: MS Teams, O365, Azure, Active Directory, and general Widows OS. </p>
            
            <p>In my spare time, I like to develop my skills and learn new things. I also love to spend my time volunteering and working at my local church. Helping others 
                is a passion of mine. I also enjoy a good movie or book and like to dabble in creative writing. I am one of those people who generally like to always be doing 
                something, and most of the time, I like that 'something' to be productive. </p>
            
            <p>To know more about me, you can use the navigation bar to see some of my latest projects and get my contact information. The link titled fun is mostly devoted 
                to some of the things I do outside of coding. You can get to know my cats or something that I currently find interesting.</p>
